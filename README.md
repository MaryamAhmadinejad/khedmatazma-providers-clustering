## Overview

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points into clusters based on similarity. This project focuses on applying **K-Means Clustering** to monthly datasets after preprocessing and feature engineering. The workflow ensures clean and meaningful input data for accurate clustering results.

## Features

- Data preprocessing:
  - Conversion of data types.
  - Monthly data abstraction.
- Feature extraction and scaling for better clustering performance.
- Selection of the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Visualization of clustering results for better interpretation.
